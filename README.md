# Background
Motivated by a desire to navigate the data scientist job market more effectively, this project was created to identify the highest-paid and most in-demand skills, helping others streamline their search for optimal jobs

Data hails from my SQL Course. It's packed with insights on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills.

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:
    1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
    2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
    3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?

# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the data Scientist job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- SQL: The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- PostgreSQL: The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- Visual Studio Code: My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- Git & GitHub: Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# The Analysis 
Each query for this project aimed to investigate specific aspects of the data scientist job market. Here‚Äôs how I approached each question:

## 1. Top-Paying Data Analyst Jobs  
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data scientist positions based on average yearly salary and location, with a particular focus on remote jobs. This query highlights the lucrative opportunities available in the field.

```sql 
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Scientist' AND
    job_location = 'Singapore' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10
```
Here's the breakdown of the top data scientist jobs in 2023:

        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)

SELECT 
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills
FROM 
    top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
